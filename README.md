# Monster-Encounter
A small little game I have been working on. This was a project I finished on the finale day of my C++ class.
It is an object oriented program where you can make you own customized monster encounter. You can edit the monsters name, the damage done by each of the monsters and the players diffrent moves, or the players and monsters health values.

Warning! there is a stack overflow error! Ill figure out how to fix it.
